# IIT BHU Logo Setup

To add the IIT BHU logo to certificates:

1. Download the official IIT BHU logo (PNG format recommended)
2. Rename it to `iit-bhu-logo.png`
3. Place it in this `public` folder
4. The logo should be:
   - PNG format with transparent background
   - Square or nearly square dimensions (e.g., 500x500px)
   - High resolution for quality (at least 300x300px)

The certificate generator will automatically use this logo if present.

## Where to get the logo:
- Official IIT BHU website
- IIT BHU branding guidelines
- College administration office

## Current status:
- Logo file: `iit-bhu-logo.png` (Place your logo file here)
- If logo is not found, certificates will be generated without it
